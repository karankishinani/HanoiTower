#IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HANOI TOWER GAME USING LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES, DYNAMIC DATA STRUCTURES AND ARCHIVES ORGANIZATION


* The main program is “proyF.cpp” *

The objective of this project is to implement and solve the game of the Tower of Hanoi using different structures such as: Stack / Recursion, Arrays, and Linked Lists and to be able to determine which of the three structures is the most adequate to solve it. In addition it will determine the organization of file to save the results of the raised problem. 

Although visually the three programs are created for the user, the differences are not denoted when executing them, but the way in which these procedures are interpreted in the computer, different amounts of processing resources are taken. Therefore, we will determine which of the three structures is most optimal for the computer based on the execution time required to solve the tower depending on the method used.
